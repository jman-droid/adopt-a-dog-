ADOPTADOG is a e-commerce website which allows users to browse and adopt dogs 
available at our flagship location. Additionally, there are details about 
each dog, various blog posts detailing helpful info regarding various aspects
of dog ownership, and a contact page to reach out with any questions users may
have.

ADOPTADOG is available for viewing on github pages while we await approval of
a custom domain.
